# Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis
Data Analysis of two hotels located in Portugal, concluding with a business recommendation. 
The data is extracted from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191
and includes information about a city and resort hotels bookings made from 2015 to 2017, e.g. time of booking, length of stay, number of adults or children, average daily expenditures, and many more. Analysis was done mainly in Python using the Pandas Library. 

## Motivation
As an aspiring data scientist, I wanted to test my abililites by working on real business datasets and see how I approach real-world problem solving. In my research I found this particular dataset, which is about 2 really existing hotels based in Algavre and Lisbon, thus including real customer data to work with. 

## Key Questions
The main problem to tackle is a way to `increase Revenues`. To give viable answers to that, we first have to identify particular important variables.
* Customer Segmentation &rarr; Aiming at optimizing the hospitality experience aimed towards a "mean Customer"
* Cancellation Rates &rarr; Identify why to come up with countermeasures
* Busiest Months/
  most cancellation in certain months &rarr; focus more/less resources in that specific time frame
* Number of booking changes &rarr; Human needed or a RPA sufficient to get the job done?
* Number of parking lots &rarr; optimal usage of available space ?
* Average Daily Rates &rarr; Find correlations in customer expenditures for the whole stay and other factors
